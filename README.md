## Hugo Site for Homework Challenges

This repo contains a static site with my responses to some coding challenges
as proposed by an awesome, Austin-based software company.

The challenges include a **database schema**, a mini full-stack **Vue-Python-Flask** app, and some **stack traces**.

This site uses **Hugo**, **Travis CI**, and **Netlify** to build and render the final site to
*stacybridges.com*.
